OpenModes
=========

A Method of Moments (Boundary Element Method) code designed to find the modes
of open resonators such as meta-atoms (the building blocks of metamaterials),
(nano) antennas, scattering particles etc. Using these modes, broadband models of these elements can be created, enabling
excitation, coupling between them and scattering to be solved easily.
