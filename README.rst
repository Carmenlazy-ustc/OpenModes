=========

A Method of Moments (Boundary Element Method) code designed to find the modes
of open resonators such as meta-atoms (the building blocks of metamaterials),
(nano) antennas, scattering particles etc.

Using these modes, broadband models of these elements can be created, enabling
excitation, coupling between them and scattering to be solved easily.

The techniques used in this package, and the scientific results obtained, are described in the
following publications and presentations:

- *Interference between the modes of an all-dielectric meta-atom*, `arXiv preprint <https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04980>`_
- *Resonant dynamics of arbitrarily shaped meta-atoms*, `published paper <http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.90.075108>`_ or
  `arXiv preprint <http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3759>`_
- *Modes in open metamaterial and nanophotonic systems*, `web presentation <http://people.physics.anu.edu.au/~dap124/aip2014/>`_.

Requires the python packages numpy, scipy and matplotlib, and the free meshing
program gmsh. See the `documentation <http://openmodes.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ 
for full installation instructions and requirements.

The source is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/DavidPowell/OpenModes>`_,
and binary packages are available from the `Python Package Index <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/OpenModes>`_.

This program was written by David Powell, a research fellow with the Nonlinear
Physics Centre at the Australian National University. Contact details are available
