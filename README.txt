Requirements
============
- numpy (1.6.2 or later)
- gmsh

Recommended packages

- matplotlib (to plot the results)
- IPython (the notebook is used by many of the examples)

Other packages which may be useful

- scipy (many useful computational python routines)
- ViSit or ParaView (to view 3D plots)

Installation Instructions
=========================

Windows
-------

Install python, and the required python packages. For windows users, this is
best done using one of the following python distributions
- WinPython
- Python(x,y)
- Enthought Python Distribution
- Anaconda

Due to the lack of good free fortran compilers for windows, you will need to
install a 32 bit version of any of these distributions

Linux
-----

For ubuntu users, the appropriate packages can be installed using the following
command

sudo apt-get install python python-numpy python-matplotlib gmsh

Mac OSX
-------

This code is not test for Mac OSX. Most likely all the required pacakges can
be installed using MacPorts, but no guarantees can be given.
