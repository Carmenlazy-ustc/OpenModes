Examples
========

The best way to understand OpenModes is to run the examples which
are included. 

1. Download the `example scripts`_ and extract them to a folder

2. Open your command windows or terminal (e.g. use the Anaconda command prompt),
   and change to the folder with the example scripts
   
3. Run the IPython notebook server, by typing ``ipython notebook`` at the command prompt.

   This should open a window in your web browser. Select one of the examples, and start playing!

OpenModes is written in python, and the syntax should look familiar to anyone
who has used matlab. To understand python for scientific uses, please read
this `tutorial`_.

The documentation includes static versions of the examples converted into web
pages. You can view the output of the examples at these pages:
