Examples
========

The best way to understand OpenModes is to run the examples which
are included. The included examples are created from the IPython notebook
files. 

*The example files are available for downloaded* from github as a `zip file`_.

If you have installed OpenModes successfully, then you can go to a
command prompt window, and change to the directory where you have extracted
the example files. Typing ``ipython notebook`` should
start the ipython notebook server, and automatically bring up a list
of example notebooks, which enable you to interact with the examples
presented here.
