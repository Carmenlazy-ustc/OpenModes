Using OpenModes
===============

The best way to understand OpenModes is to run the examples which
are included. The included examples are created using the IPython notebook
viewer. The original IPython notebook files for these examples can 
be downloaded from the github repository_.

If you have installed OpenModes successfully, then you can go to a
command prompt window, and change to the directory where the example
file is located. Typing `ipython notebook` should
start the ipython notebook server, and automatically bring up a list
of example notebooks, which enable you to interact with the examples
presented here.
