Using OpenModes
===============

The best way to understand OpenModes is to run the examples which
are included. This is most conveniently done using the IPython notebook
viewer. If you have installed it successfully, then you can go to a
command prompt window, and change to the `example` directory of the
OpenModes installation. Typing `ipython notebook --pylab=inline` should
start the ipython notebook server, and automatically bring up a list
of example notebooks, which enable you to interact with the examples
presented here.
