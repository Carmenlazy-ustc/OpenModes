OpenModes is a code aimed at solving the modes of open electromagnetic structures.
Using these modes, broadband models of these elements can be created, enabling
excitation, coupling between them and scattering to be solved easily.

Potential applications include metamaterials, (nano) antennas and other systems
based on scattering from resonant elements. It is based on a fully numerical model
of the system created using the method of moments (MOM).

The techniques used in this package, and the scientific results obtained, are described in the
following publications and presentations:

- *Interference between the modes of an all-dielectric meta-atom*, `arXiv preprint <https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04980>`_
- *Resonant dynamics of arbitrarily shaped meta-atoms*, `published paper <http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.90.075108>`_ or
  `arXiv preprint <http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3759>`_
- *Modes in open metamaterial and nanophotonic systems*, `web presentation <http://people.physics.anu.edu.au/~dap124/aip2014/>`_.

This program was written by David Powell, a research fellow with the Nonlinear
Physics Centre at the Australian National University. Contact details are available
on my `web page <http://wwwrsphysse.anu.edu.au/nonlinear/people/DavidPowell.shtml>`_.

To begin using the software, follow the :doc:`getting started instructions <gettingstarted>`.

The :doc:`examples` give an overview of OpenModes' capabilities, and can be viewed online.
