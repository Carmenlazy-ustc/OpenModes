OpenModes
=========

OpenModes is a code aimed at solving the modes of open electromagnetic structures.
Using these modes, broadband models of these elements can be created, enabling
excitation, coupling between them and scattering to be solved easily.

Potential applications include metamaterials, (nano) antennas and other systems
based on scattering from resonant elements. It is based on a fully numerical model
of the system created using the method of moments (MOM).
