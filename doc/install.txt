Installation Instructions
=========================

OpenModes is written in the `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ language, and
utilises the program gmsh to mesh the structure geometries.

Windows Quick Install
---------------------

The simplest way to get started is to download `Python(x,y) 
<https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/>`_, which includes all the required python 
libraries. 

Then install `gmsh <http://geuz.org/gmsh/>`_, and make sure that the gmsh
executable is added to the windows PATH environment variable.

Download the OpenModes executable package from ??? and install it using the
WinPython/Python(x,y) package manager.

Requirements
------------
The following software packages are the absolute minimum to run OpenModes:

- python 2.7 (3.x not currently supported)
- numpy (1.6.2 or later)
- scipy
- gmsh
- matplotlib (to plot the results)

Strongly recommended packages

- IPython (the notebook is used by many of the examples)
- pyvtk (to export 3D plots to vtk file format)
- ViSit or ParaView (3D plotting software to view vtk files)

Other packages which may be useful

- spyder (a GUI for editing python)
- mayavi (a python package for producing 3D plots)

OpenModes contains some core routines which are optimised using fortran.
Therefore, on platforms where a binary package of OpenModes is not provided,
a fortran compiler is required.


For windows users, there are several choices of scientific python distribution
which may also be suitable

- WinPython (known to work)
- Anaconda
- Enthought Python Distribution

Due to the lack of reliable free 64 bit fortran compilers for windows, you will
need to install a 32 bit version of any of these distributions

Ubuntu Linux
------------

For ubuntu users, the appropriate packages can be installed using the following
command

``sudo apt-get install python python-numpy python-matplotlib gmsh gfortran
ipython python-dev pyvtk??``

Mac OSX
-------

This code has not been tested for Mac OSX, but there is no known reason why it should
not work. All required packages are available from the MacPorts project. 

Manual Install for Windows
--------------------------

Manual installation under windows is difficult, as it requires the use of 
mingw compilers.

MingW 4.8 has a bug which causes the fortran extensions to randomly generate
NaNs in the returned arrays if optimisation levels -O2 or -O3 are specified.

The windows binaries were successfully built under the mingw-64 
x32-4.8.1-posix-dwarf-rev5 compiler.
