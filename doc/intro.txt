Introduction
============

OpenModes is a code aimed at solving the modes of open electromagnetic structures.
Potential applications include metamaterials, (nano) antennas and other systems
based on scattering from resonant elements. It is based on a fully numerical model
of the system created using the method of moments (MOM).

A paper describing the method used to find the modes will be placed online soon.
