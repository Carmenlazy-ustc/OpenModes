Introduction
============

OpenModes is a code aimed at solving the modes of open electromagnetic structures.
Potential applications include metamaterials, (nano) antennas and other systems
based on scattering from resonant elements. It is based on a fully numerical model
of the system created using the method of moments (MOM).

A paper describing the method used to find the modes is available as an
`arXiv preprint <http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3759>`_.

Source and binary packages are hosted at available `here <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/OpenModes>`_,
and the source code can be found on `GitHub <https://github.com/DavidPowell/OpenModes>`_.
