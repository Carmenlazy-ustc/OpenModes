Incorporated Software
---------------------

* This program incorporates `Fortran code <http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/f_src/triangle_dunavant_rule/triangle_dunavant_rule.html>`_
  for symmetric integration rules over triangles, written
  by John Burkardt, and distributed under the GNU LGPL license.

* The code incorporates `routines for singular integrals <http://homerreid.dyndns.org/scuff-EM/SingularIntegrals/>`_
  written by M. T. Homer Reid, and distributed under the GNU GPL v2 license. This code forms part of the
  `scuff-EM <http://homerreid.dyndns.org/scuff-EM>`_ MOM solver. Currently these routines are not
  used by default, but served as an invaluable reference for debugging purposes.
  
* The automated extraction of version numbers from the git repository was written by
  `Douglas Creager <http://dcreager.net/2010/02/10/setuptools-git-version-numbers/>`_.

* Three-dimensional plots within the IPython notebook are enabled by the use of the `three.js <http://threejs.org/>`_
  library, which is partly incorporated into this project.

* Code for an `ordered set <https://github.com/LuminosoInsight/ordered-set>`_ originally written by
  Raymond Hettiger is incorporated under the MIT license.
