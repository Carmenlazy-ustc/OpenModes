Incorporated Software
---------------------

* This program incorporates `Fortran code <http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/f_src/triangle_dunavant_rule/triangle_dunavant_rule.html>`_
  for symmetric integration rules over triangles, written
  by John Burkardt, and distributed under the GNU LGPL license.

* The automated extraction of version numbers from the git repository was written by
  `Douglas Creager <http://dcreager.net/2010/02/10/setuptools-git-version-numbers/>`_.

* Three-dimensional plots within the IPython notebook are enabled by the use of the `three.js <http://threejs.org/>`_
  library, which is partly incorporated into this project.

* Code for an `ordered set <https://github.com/LuminosoInsight/ordered-set>`_ originally written by
  Raymond Hettiger is incorporated under the MIT license.

* Code for testing whether a point is within a polygon by softsurfer has been used, converted to
  python by Maciej Kalisiak. Adapted from <http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~mac/e-stuff/>`_.
