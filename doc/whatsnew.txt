What's new in OpenModes
=======================

**Release 0.0.2**

August, 2014

Major changes which are visible to the user:

- The incident field weighting can now be performed in pure python code, instead
  of fortran subroutines. This makes it easier to model sources other than plane waves.
- The use of logging is simplified, to allow simulation progress to be monitored.
- Fixed several cases where data structures could not be pickled. This means that 
  structures can be cached or transmitted across the network for parallel computing.
- Additional pre-made geometries are included
- Planar structures with internal holes are now handled correctly

**Release 0.0.1**

May, 2014
