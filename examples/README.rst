These example files are for the `IPython <http://ipython.org/>`_, notebook,
an interactive web-based frontend to python. Download the example files to a directory,
and from your command-line, run ``ipython notebook``. You can then open any of the files,
and run the complete worksheet from the menu bar by selecting ``Cell->Run All``. Make sure you use
the command prompt which loads your python environment (e.g. Anaconda command prompt).

For convenience, a static web-based view of these examples is available, where you can 
view the output of previously run files, but no changes can be made:
