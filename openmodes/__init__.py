    Open a geometry file and mesh it (or directly open a mesh file), then
    convert it into a mesh object.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : string
        The name of the file to open. Can be a gmsh .msh file, or a gmsh 
        geometry file, which will be meshed first
    mesh_tol : float, optional
        If opening a geometry file, it will be meshed with this tolerance

        Ensure that a tuple is always returned, even if only a single part

    -------
    parts : tuple
        A tuple of `SimulationParts`, one for each separate geometric entity
