See the [documentation](http://www.pythonhosted.org/OpenModes/) \r\nfor full installation instructions and requirements.\r\n\r\nThe source is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/DavidPowell/OpenModes),\r\nand binary packages are available from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/OpenModes).\r\n\r\nThis program was written by David Powell, a research fellow with the Nonlinear\r\nPhysics Centre at the Australian National University.
